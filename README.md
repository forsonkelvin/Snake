# Snake
A snake arcade game that uses an Abstract Game Engine to rendered UI elements with a responsive model. 

# UI Elements
1. The snake is made up of white squares with the a blue circular head.
2. Red squares are  thorn elements which when collided by the snake results in a game over.
3. The green squares are fruits which are eaten by the snake to grow in length.
4. The grey circular objects are bullets the snake can use to destroy thorns on screen.


# Controls
The game was constructed to make the snake moving at all times.<br> 
The left arrow key and right arrow key are used for controlling the snake's direction. <br>
Use left for upwards and left turns when the snake is moving in horizonatal and vertical directions respectively.<br>
The opposite is for the right arrow key.<br>
